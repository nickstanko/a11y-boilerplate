The Accessibility Boilerplate is a basic HTML template to kickstart your web project responsibly.

The boilerplate aims to provide a sensible default template, using plain old semantic markup, to correctly structure your content, making it easily accessible by search engines and assistive technologies. This project therefore uses [HTML5 syntax](http://diveintohtml5.info/) enhanced with [ARIA roles](http://blog.paciellogroup.com/2013/02/using-wai-aria-landmarks-2013/) and [Microdata](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/176035?hl=en). The best way to get started is to simply jump into the [index.html code](https://github.com/voorhoede/a11y-boilerplate/blob/gh-pages/index.html).

For best practices on other common files and configurations have a look at [html5-boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/).
